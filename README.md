Prayana
=======

Prayana '10 was a online treasure hunt event developed for my college's technical symposium in the year 2010.
The user will play this game on a website. The user will have thought provoking questions. For each right answer,
he will move to the next level. The website was developed using LAMP stack. As the website involved a lot of users,
the website was developed with good protection against all the common attacks.

Requirements: LAMP stack.
